I graduated from the Belarusian State Economic University. For the last 10 years of my life I have been working in the trade. Now I am in a managerial position in one of the stores of a large retail chain. I don't like my job. It does not bring pleasure, it takes a lot of strength and energy. I want to become a front-end developer at EPAM. My strengths are perseverance, perseverance, ability to multitask, self-confidence and a desire to go all the way. I believe these qualities will help me successfully complete my training and become part of the EPAM team.
